Experiment in Github Repo Poetry

Ode to a Repo:
Repo,
Repo,
This is
a Repo...

Do you want to commit to this repo?
I don't know?
Ok!

Let's commit to this
Repo!

Repo!
Repo!
REPO!

Baby, you got me like ah, woo, ah
Don't you stop loving me, loving me
Don't quit loving me, loving me
Just start loving me, love me
