Experiment in Github Repo Poetry

Ode to a Repo:
Repo,
Repo,
This is
a Repo...

Do you want to commit to this repo?
I don't know?
Ok!

Let's commit to this
Repo!

Repo!
Repo!
REPO!
REPOOOOOOOOOOO

Is this the real life...

Is this just fantasy?

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
